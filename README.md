# c-chat

`c-chat` is a modern, local-first AI chat application built with [Tauri v2](https://tauri.app/) and [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/). It provides a powerful, privacy-focused interface for interacting with LLMs, featuring advanced capabilities like branching conversations and Model Context Protocol (MCP) support.

## Features

-   **Local-First Architecture**: Your chats and data are stored locally on your device for maximum privacy and speed.
-   **Advanced Chat Interface**:
    -   **Branching**: Easily branch conversations at any point to explore different paths without losing context.
    -   **Context Management**: Managing context across long conversations.
    -   **Artifacts**: View generated code, HTML, and other content in a dedicated artifacts view.
-   **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: First-class support for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), allowing the AI to connect to external tools and data sources reliably.
    -   Connect to local or remote MCP servers.
    -   Use tools directly within the chat interface.
-   **Projects**: Organize your chats into projects for better management.
-   **Customizable AI**:
    -   Connect to any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.
    -   Configure custom system prompts.
    -   Adjust model parameters (temperature, context size).
-   **Modern UI/UX**:
    -   Built with TailwindCSS v4.
    -   Native look and feel with Mica/Vibrancy effects on Windows and macOS.
    -   Dark mode support.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS v4, Pinia
-   **Backend**: Tauri (Rust), `rmcp` (Rust MCP implementation)
-   **Storage**: `tauri-plugin-store` (local JSON file storage)

## Prerequisites

Before building `c-chat`, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js** (v18 or later)
-   **Rust & Cargo** (latest stable)
-   **System Dependencies**: Follow the [Tauri prerequisites guide](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your operating system.

## Installation & Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/c-chat.git
    cd c-chat
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # or
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run in development mode:**
    ```bash
    pnpm tauri dev
    # or
    npm run tauri dev
    ```
    This will start the frontend dev server and the Tauri application window.

4.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    pnpm tauri build
    ```

## Configuration

### Setting up Models
1.  Go to the **Settings** page in the application.
2.  Add a new **Endpoint** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or a local server like Ollama/vLLM).
    -   URL: The base URL for the API (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`).
    -   API Key: Your API key.
3.  Add **Models** linked to that endpoint.

### using MCP Servers
1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **MCP Servers**.
2.  Add a server configuration:
    -   **Transport**: Choose between SSE (Server-Sent Events) or Stdio (if supported locally via command). *Current implementation primarily supports HTTP/SSE transports.*
    -   **URL**: The URL of the MCP server.


## Feature Guide

### 🔄 Synchronization
`c-chat` includes a robust sync engine to keep your chats, settings, and projects in sync across devices.
1.  Go to **Settings** > **Sync**.
2.  Enter your Sync Token.
3.  The app will automatically sync your data. It uses smart activity detection to sync frequently when you are active and less frequently when idle.

### 🌿 Branching & Timeline
Never lose context with advanced branching:
-   **Branching**: Edit any message in a conversation to create a divergence. The original message and path remain saved.
-   **Navigation**: Use the arrow keys or UI controls to switch between different branches (siblings) of a conversation.
-   **Tree-based History**: The entire conversation history is stored as a tree, allowing you to explore different "what-if" scenarios.

### 📂 Projects
Organize your work with Projects:
-   Create projects to group related chat sessions.
-   Drag and drop chats into projects.
-   Manage project-specific settings.

### 📦 Artifacts
Artifacts are special content blocks (like Code, HTML, or SVG) generated by the AI:
-   They appear in a dedicated panel.
-   They are versioned and stored with the session.
-   You can iterate on artifacts by asking the AI to update them.
